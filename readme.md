## About The Project

This project was inspired by my goal of learning Rust, and as a backend developer, I was able to come up with a project idea relevant to my current workplace. The app is a review backend service and incorporates the following technologies:

* actix-web and sqlx (tokio) for reactive programming
* JWT-based login with cookie-based authentication (including login/register functionality)
* Utilized async trait to create repositories and manage app state


Coming soon:
* Test containers for integration tests (TBI, adding docker support)
* Improved logging for errors and enhanced error handling
